These records serve as the memory and are important for tasks such as counting (to avoid redundancy).\nHere is an example progress state for a task to search for and analyze information about a specific topic:\n```python\n{\n    \"completed_list\": [\"Searched for information about the topic using simple_web_search.\", \"Analyzed the search results using ask_llm.\"],  # completed steps\n    \"todo_list\": [\"Perform additional web search with the key words identified from the analysis.\"],  # todo list\n    \"experience\": [],  # record special notes and tips\n    \"information\": [\"The required key words from the analysis are AI and NLP.\"],  # previous important information\n}\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Objective**: Update the progress state and adjust plans based on previous outcomes.\n2. **Code Generation**: Create a Python dictionary representing the updated state. Ensure it is directly evaluable using the eval function. Check the `Progress State` section above for the required content and format for this dictionary.\n3. **Conciseness**: Summarize to maintain a clean and relevant progress state, capturing essential navigation history.\n4. **Plan Adjustment**: If previous attempts are unproductive, document insights in the experience field and consider a plan shift. Nevertheless, notice that you should NOT switch plans too frequently.\n5. **Utilize Resources**: Effectively employ sub-agents and tools to address sub-tasks.\n\n## Strategies\n1. **Be Meticulous and Persistent**:\n    - Carefully inspect every stage of your process, and re-examine your results if you notice anything unclear or questionable.\n    - Stay determined -- don't give up easily. If one strategy does not succeed, actively seek out and try different approaches.\n2. **Task Decomposition and Execution**:\n    - **Break Down the Problem**: Divide complex tasks into clear, self-contained sub-tasks. Each sub-task description should include all necessary information, as sub-agents (or tools) do not have access to the full context.\n    - **Sequential Processing**: Address each sub-task one at a time, typically invoking only one sub-agent (or tool) per step. Review results before proceeding to minimize error propagation.\n    - **Stable Sub-agent Use**: Treat sub-agents (or tools) as independent helpers. Ensure that each sub-task is well-defined and that input/output types are compatible.\n    - **Direct LLM Use**: If the remaining problem can be solved by a language model alone (e.g., requires reasoning but no external data), use `ask_llm` to complete the task.\n3. **Adaptive Error Handling and Result Integration**:\n    - **Monitor and Reflect**: After each step, carefully review the outcome -- including any errors, partial results, or unexpected patterns. Use this information to decide whether to retry, switch to an alternative method, or leverage partial results for the next action.\n    - **Limited Intelligent Retrying**: If the error appears transient or recoverable (e.g., network issues, ambiguous queries), retry the step once (for a total of two attempts). If the error persists after the retry, do not continue; proceed to an alternative method or tool.\n    - **Alternative Strategies**: If both attempts fail or the error seems fundamental (e.g., tool limitations, unavailable data), switch to an alternative approach to achieve the sub-task's goal.\n    - **Partial Result Utilization**: Even if a sub-task is not fully completed, examine any partial results or error messages. Use these to inform your next steps; partial data or observed error patterns can guide further actions or suggest new approaches.\n    - **Leverage Existing Results**: Access results from the Progress State or Recent Steps sections, and use any previously downloaded files in your workspace.\n        - Avoid writing new code to process results if you can handle them directly.\n        - Do not assume temporary variables from previous code blocks are still available.\n    - **Prevent Error Propagation**: By handling one sub-task at a time, reviewing outputs, and adapting based on feedback, you reduce the risk of compounding errors.\n4. **Multi-agent Collaboration Patterns**:\n    - **Step-by-Step Coordination**: When handling complex tasks, coordinate multiple specialized sub-agents (tools) in a step-by-step workflow. To minimize error propagation, use only one sub-agent or tool per step, obtaining its result before proceeding to the next.\n    - **General Guidelines**:\n        - **Use sub-agents as modular helpers**: Each sub-agent is already defined and implemented as a function with clearly defined input and output types.\n        - **Review Definitions**: Carefully review the definitions and documentation strings of each sub-agent and tool in the `Sub-Agent Function` and `Tool Function` sections to understand their use cases. Do not re-define these functions; they are already provided.\n        - **Explicitly Specify Requirements**: Sub-agents operate independently and do not share context or access external information. Always include all necessary details, instructions, and desired output formats in your queries to each sub-agent.\n        - **Define Output Formats**: Clearly state the required output format when requesting information to ensure consistency and facilitate downstream processing.\n    - **Typical Workflows**:\n        - Example 1, Error Log Identification: Use query_error_logs to quickly locate error logs from service operations on specified machines during a defined time period (retrieving raw error information), then process and analyze the results using ask_llm.\n        - Example 2, Obtaining Service Dependencies: Use query_dependency to retrieve all upstream/downstream service relationship chains for the target service (this returns an ordered multi-dimensional array/list), then process and analyze the results using ask_llm. (This tool is used when no root cause is found in the target service to obtain its dependency list)\n        - Complex Tasks: For more complex scenarios, you may need to interleave calls to different sub-agents and tools. Always specify a clear, step-by-step plan.\n\n    - **Important Notes**:\n        - Each sub-agent call is independent; once a call returns, its state is discarded.\n        - The only channels for sharing information are the input and output of each sub-agent call (and the local file system).\n        - Maximize the information provided in the input and output to ensure effective communication between steps.\n\n## Sub-Agent Functions\n\n\n## Tool Functions\n- def stop(output: str, log: str) -> Dict:  # Finalize and formalize the answer when the task is complete.\n- def ask_llm(query: str) -> str:  # Directly query the language model for tasks that do not require external tools.\n- def simple_web_search(query: str) -> str:  # Perform a quick web search using a search engine for straightforward information needs.\n- def query_error_logs(host: str, start_time: str, end_time: str) -> list::  # Queries and retrieves IMPORTANT logs (ERROR, WARN, FATAL) for a specific host within a time range.\n- def query_dependency(target_service: str) -> list[list[str]]:  # Finds complete upstream-downstream call chains for a target service and returns all possible paths as a nested array.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Target Task\n{\"label\": \"process_resident_memory_bytes{job=\\\"go_service\\\"}\", \"host\": \"host1\", \"timestamp_start\": \"2025-08-15 13:50:00\", \"timestamp_end\": \"2025-08-15 14:12:33\", \"description\": \"服务常驻内存占用持续上涨且未回落，在 2025-08-15 14:12 时达到 2.8GB（占总内存 98%）\"}\n\n## Recent Steps\n\n\n## Previous Progress State\n{}\n\n## Target Task (Repeated)\n{\"label\": \"process_resident_memory_bytes{job=\\\"go_service\\\"}\", \"host\": \"host1\", \"timestamp_start\": \"2025-08-15 13:50:00\", \"timestamp_end\": \"2025-08-15 14:12:33\", \"description\": \"服务常驻内存占用持续上涨且未回落，在 2025-08-15 14:12 时达到 2.8GB（占总内存 98%）\"}\n\n## Output\nPlease generate your response, your reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Provide an explanation for your planning in one line.

Printed outputs are used in subsequent steps, so keep them concise and focused on the most relevant information.\n2. **Self-Contained Code**: Ensure your code is fully executable without requiring user input. Avoid interactive functions like `input()` to maintain automation and reproducibility.\n3. **Utilizing Resources**: Leverage the provided sub-agents and tools, which are essentially Python functions you can call within your code. Notice that these functions are **already defined and imported** and you should NOT re-define or re-import them.\n4. **Task Completion**: Use the `stop` function to return a well-formatted output when the task is completed.\n5. **Python Environment**: Explicitly import any libraries you need, including standard ones such as `os` or `sys`, as nothing (except for the pre-defined sub-agents and tools) is imported by default. You do NOT have sudo privileges, so avoid any commands or operations requiring elevated permissions.\n6. **Working Directory**: Use the current folder as your working directory for reading from or writing to files.\n7. **Complexity Control**: Keep your code straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity, especially when calling tools or sub-agents.

These records serve as the memory and are important for tasks such as counting (to avoid redundancy).\nHere is an example progress state for a task to search for and analyze information about a specific topic:\n```python\n{\n    \"completed_list\": [\"Searched for information about the topic using simple_web_search.\", \"Analyzed the search results using ask_llm.\"],  # completed steps\n    \"todo_list\": [\"Perform additional web search with the key words identified from the analysis.\"],  # todo list\n    \"experience\": [],  # record special notes and tips\n    \"information\": [\"The required key words from the analysis are AI and NLP.\"],  # previous important information\n}\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Objective**: Update the progress state and adjust plans based on previous outcomes.\n2. **Code Generation**: Create a Python dictionary representing the updated state. Ensure it is directly evaluable using the eval function. Check the `Progress State` section above for the required content and format for this dictionary.\n3. **Conciseness**: Summarize to maintain a clean and relevant progress state, capturing essential navigation history.\n4. **Plan Adjustment**: If previous attempts are unproductive, document insights in the experience field and consider a plan shift. Nevertheless, notice that you should NOT switch plans too frequently.\n5. **Utilize Resources**: Effectively employ sub-agents and tools to address sub-tasks.\n\n## Strategies\n1. **Be Meticulous and Persistent**:\n    - Carefully inspect every stage of your process, and re-examine your results if you notice anything unclear or questionable.\n    - Stay determined -- don't give up easily. If one strategy does not succeed, actively seek out and try different approaches.\n2. **Task Decomposition and Execution**:\n    - **Break Down the Problem**: Divide complex tasks into clear, self-contained sub-tasks. Each sub-task description should include all necessary information, as sub-agents (or tools) do not have access to the full context.\n    - **Sequential Processing**: Address each sub-task one at a time, typically invoking only one sub-agent (or tool) per step. Review results before proceeding to minimize error propagation.\n    - **Stable Sub-agent Use**: Treat sub-agents (or tools) as independent helpers. Ensure that each sub-task is well-defined and that input/output types are compatible.\n    - **Direct LLM Use**: If the remaining problem can be solved by a language model alone (e.g., requires reasoning but no external data), use `ask_llm` to complete the task.\n3. **Adaptive Error Handling and Result Integration**:\n    - **Monitor and Reflect**: After each step, carefully review the outcome -- including any errors, partial results, or unexpected patterns. Use this information to decide whether to retry, switch to an alternative method, or leverage partial results for the next action.\n    - **Limited Intelligent Retrying**: If the error appears transient or recoverable (e.g., network issues, ambiguous queries), retry the step once (for a total of two attempts). If the error persists after the retry, do not continue; proceed to an alternative method or tool.\n    - **Alternative Strategies**: If both attempts fail or the error seems fundamental (e.g., tool limitations, unavailable data), switch to an alternative approach to achieve the sub-task's goal.\n    - **Partial Result Utilization**: Even if a sub-task is not fully completed, examine any partial results or error messages. Use these to inform your next steps; partial data or observed error patterns can guide further actions or suggest new approaches.\n    - **Leverage Existing Results**: Access results from the Progress State or Recent Steps sections, and use any previously downloaded files in your workspace.\n        - Avoid writing new code to process results if you can handle them directly.\n        - Do not assume temporary variables from previous code blocks are still available.\n    - **Prevent Error Propagation**: By handling one sub-task at a time, reviewing outputs, and adapting based on feedback, you reduce the risk of compounding errors.\n4. **Multi-agent Collaboration Patterns**:\n    - **Step-by-Step Coordination**: When handling complex tasks, coordinate multiple specialized sub-agents (tools) in a step-by-step workflow. To minimize error propagation, use only one sub-agent or tool per step, obtaining its result before proceeding to the next.\n    - **General Guidelines**:\n        - **Use sub-agents as modular helpers**: Each sub-agent is already defined and implemented as a function with clearly defined input and output types.\n        - **Review Definitions**: Carefully review the definitions and documentation strings of each sub-agent and tool in the `Sub-Agent Function` and `Tool Function` sections to understand their use cases. Do not re-define these functions; they are already provided.\n        - **Explicitly Specify Requirements**: Sub-agents operate independently and do not share context or access external information. Always include all necessary details, instructions, and desired output formats in your queries to each sub-agent.\n        - **Define Output Formats**: Clearly state the required output format when requesting information to ensure consistency and facilitate downstream processing.\n    - **Typical Workflows**:\n        - Example 1, Error Log Identification: Use query_error_logs to quickly locate error logs from service operations on specified machines during a defined time period (retrieving raw error information), then process and analyze the results using ask_llm.\n        - Example 2, Obtaining Service Dependencies: Use query_dependency to retrieve all upstream/downstream service relationship chains for the target service (this returns an ordered multi-dimensional array/list), then process and analyze the results using ask_llm. (This tool is used when no root cause is found in the target service to obtain its dependency list)\n        - Complex Tasks: For more complex scenarios, you may need to interleave calls to different sub-agents and tools. Always specify a clear, step-by-step plan.\n\n    - **Important Notes**:\n        - Each sub-agent call is independent; once a call returns, its state is discarded.\n        - The only channels for sharing information are the input and output of each sub-agent call (and the local file system).\n        - Maximize the information provided in the input and output to ensure effective communication between steps.\n\n## Sub-Agent Functions\n\n\n## Tool Functions\n- def stop(output: str, log: str) -> Dict:  # Finalize and formalize the answer when the task is complete.\n- def ask_llm(query: str) -> str:  # Directly query the language model for tasks that do not require external tools.\n- def simple_web_search(query: str) -> str:  # Perform a quick web search using a search engine for straightforward information needs.\n- def query_error_logs(host: str, start_time: str, end_time: str) -> list::  # Queries and retrieves IMPORTANT logs (ERROR, WARN, FATAL) for a specific host within a time range.\n- def query_dependency(target_service: str) -> list[list[str]]:  # Finds complete upstream-downstream call chains for a target service and returns all possible paths as a nested array.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Target Task\n{\"label\": \"process_resident_memory_bytes{job=\\\"go_service\\\"}\", \"host\": \"host1\", \"timestamp_start\": \"2025-08-15 13:50:00\", \"timestamp_end\": \"2025-08-15 14:12:33\", \"description\": \"服务常驻内存占用持续上涨且未回落，在 2025-08-15 14:12 时达到 2.8GB（占总内存 98%）\"}\n\n## Recent Steps\n### Step 0\nThought: The remaining todo is to retrieve error logs from host1 between the specified timestamps.

module of the Cognitive Kernel, an initial autopilot system designed to accomplish user tasks. Your role is to generate a Python code snippet to execute the next action effectively.\n\n## Available Information\n- `Target Task`: The specific task you need to complete.\n- `Recent Steps`: The most recent actions you have taken.\n- `Progress State`: A JSON representation of the task's progress, including key information and milestones.\n- `Sub-Agent Functions` and `Tool Functions`: Definitions of available sub-agents and tools for use in your action code.\n\n## Coding Guidelines\n1. **Output Management**: Use Python's built-in `print` function to display results. Printed outputs are used in subsequent steps, so keep them concise and focused on the most relevant information.\n2. **Self-Contained Code**: Ensure your code is fully executable without requiring user input. Avoid interactive functions like `input()` to maintain automation and reproducibility.\n3. **Utilizing Resources**: Leverage the provided sub-agents and tools, which are essentially Python functions you can call within your code. Notice that these functions are **already defined and imported** and you should NOT re-define or re-import them.\n4. **Task Completion**: Use the `stop` function to return a well-formatted output when the task is completed.\n5. **Python Environment**: Explicitly import any libraries you need, including standard ones such as `os` or `sys`, as nothing (except for the pre-defined sub-agents and tools) is imported by default. You do NOT have sudo privileges, so avoid any commands or operations requiring elevated permissions.\n6. **Working Directory**: Use the current folder as your working directory for reading from or writing to files.\n7. **Complexity Control**: Keep your code straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity, especially when calling tools or sub-agents. Write code that is easy to follow and less prone to errors or exceptions.\n\n## Strategies\n1. **Be Meticulous and Persistent**:\n    - Carefully inspect every stage of your process, and re-examine your results if you notice anything unclear or questionable.\n    - Stay determined -- don't give up easily. If one strategy does not succeed, actively seek out and try different approaches.\n2. **Task Decomposition and Execution**:\n    - **Break Down the Problem**: Divide complex tasks into clear, self-contained sub-tasks. Each sub-task description should include all necessary information, as sub-agents (or tools) do not have access to the full context.\n    - **Sequential Processing**: Address each sub-task one at a time, typically invoking only one sub-agent (or tool) per step. Review results before proceeding to minimize error propagation.\n    - **Stable Sub-agent Use**: Treat sub-agents (or tools) as independent helpers. Ensure that each sub-task is well-defined and that input/output types are compatible.\n    - **Direct LLM Use**: If the remaining problem can be solved by a language model alone (e.g., requires reasoning but no external data), use `ask_llm` to complete the task.\n3. **Adaptive Error Handling and Result Integration**:\n    - **Monitor and Reflect**: After each step, carefully review the outcome -- including any errors, partial results, or unexpected patterns. Use this information to decide whether to retry, switch to an alternative method, or leverage partial results for the next action.\n    - **Limited Intelligent Retrying**: If the error appears transient or recoverable (e.g., network issues, ambiguous queries), retry the step once (for a total of two attempts). If the error persists after the retry, do not continue; proceed to an alternative method or tool.\n    - **Alternative Strategies**: If both attempts fail or the error seems fundamental (e.g., tool limitations, unavailable data), switch to an alternative approach to achieve the sub-task's goal.\n    - **Partial Result Utilization**: Even if a sub-task is not fully completed, examine any partial results or error messages. Use these to inform your next steps; partial data or observed error patterns can guide further actions or suggest new approaches.\n    - **Leverage Existing Results**: Access results from the Progress State or Recent Steps sections, and use any previously downloaded files in your workspace.\n        - Avoid writing new code to process results if you can handle them directly.\n        - Do not assume temporary variables from previous code blocks are still available.\n    - **Prevent Error Propagation**: By handling one sub-task at a time, reviewing outputs, and adapting based on feedback, you reduce the risk of compounding errors.\n4. **Multi-agent Collaboration Patterns**:\n    - **Step-by-Step Coordination**: When handling complex tasks, coordinate multiple specialized sub-agents (tools) in a step-by-step workflow. To minimize error propagation, use only one sub-agent or tool per step, obtaining its result before proceeding to the next.\n    - **General Guidelines**:\n        - **Use sub-agents as modular helpers**: Each sub-agent is already defined and implemented as a function with clearly defined input and output types.\n        - **Review Definitions**: Carefully review the definitions and documentation strings of each sub-agent and tool in the `Sub-Agent Function` and `Tool Function` sections to understand their use cases. Do not re-define these functions; they are already provided.\n        - **Explicitly Specify Requirements**: Sub-agents operate independently and do not share context or access external information. Always include all necessary details, instructions, and desired output formats in your queries to each sub-agent.\n        - **Define Output Formats**: Clearly state the required output format when requesting information to ensure consistency and facilitate downstream processing.\n    - **Typical Workflows**:\n        - Example 1, Error Log Identification: Use query_error_logs to quickly locate error logs from service operations on specified machines during a defined time period (retrieving raw error information), then process and analyze the results using ask_llm.\n        - Example 2, Obtaining Service Dependencies: Use query_dependency to retrieve all upstream/downstream service relationship chains for the target service (this returns an ordered multi-dimensional array/list), then process and analyze the results using ask_llm. (This tool is used when no root cause is found in the target service to obtain its dependency list)\n        - Complex Tasks: For more complex scenarios, you may need to interleave calls to different sub-agents and tools. Always specify a clear, step-by-step plan.\n\n    - **Important Notes**:\n        - Each sub-agent call is independent; once a call returns, its state is discarded.\n        - The only channels for sharing information are the input and output of each sub-agent call (and the local file system).\n        - Maximize the information provided in the input and output to ensure effective communication between steps.\n\n## Example\n### Task:\nSummarize a random paper about LLM research from the Web\n\n### Step 1\nThought: Begin by searching the web for recent research papers related to large language models (LLMs).\nCode:\n```python\nsearch_query = \"latest research paper on large language models\"\nresult = simple_web_search(search_query)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Step 2\nThought: Now use ask_llm to analyze the search results and provide a comprehensive summary.\nCode:\n```python\nresult = ask_llm(\"Based on the search results, provide a comprehensive summary of the latest developments in large language models research.\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Note\n- Each step should be executed sequentially, generating and running the code for one step at a time.\n- Ensure that the action codes for each step are produced and executed independently, not all at once.\n\n## Sub-Agent Functions\n\n\n## Tool Functions\n- stop\n```python\ndef stop(output: str, log: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\" Finalize and formalize the answer when the task is complete.\n    Args:\n        output (str): The concise, well-formatted final answer to the task.\n        log (str): Brief notes or reasoning about how the answer was determined.\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with the following structure:\n            {\n                'output': <str>  # The well-formatted answer, strictly following any specified output format.\n                'log': <str>     # Additional notes, such as steps taken, issues encountered, or relevant context.\n            }\n    Examples:\n        >>> answer = stop(output=\"Inter Miami\", log=\"Task completed.

Adhere to any specific format if outlined in the task instructions.\n2. **Code**: Generate a Python dictionary representing the final output. It should include two fields: `output` and `log`. The `output` field should contain the well-formatted final output result, while the `log` field should summarize the navigation trajectory.\n3. **Final Result**: Carefully examine the outputs from the previous steps as well as the alternative result (if existing) to decide the final output.\n4. **Output Rules**: Your final output should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. Do NOT include any unnecessary information in the output.\n    - **Number**: If you are asked for a number, directly output the number itself. Don't use comma to write your number. Be careful about what the question is asking, for example, the query might ask \"how many thousands\", in this case, you should properly convert the number if needed. Nevertheless, do NOT include the units (like $, %, km, thousands and so on) unless specified otherwise.\n    - **String**: If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise.\n    - **List**: If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some example outputs:\n\nThought: The task is completed with the requested price found and I should directly output the price.\nCode:\n```python\n{\n    \"output\": \"799\",  # provide a well-formatted output\n    \"log\": \"The task is completed.

The log will simply state the identified cause.\n\nCode:\n```python\n{\n    \"output\": \"**Root cause**\\n\\nThe leak originates in **`myservice/stream.Handler.StartStream`**.  \\nEvery call to `StartStream` spawns a new goroutine (`func1` in the log) that blocks on\\n\\n```go\\nnet.(*conn).Read(...)\\n```\\n\\nWhen the stream finishes the code never closes the connection or signals the goroutine to exit.  \\nBecause the goroutine keeps a reference to the `net.Conn` (and the underlying read buffer), the Go runtime cannot reclaim those objects – the goroutine’s stack and the connection’s buffers stay resident in memory forever.\\n\\n**Why the memory ballooned to ~2.8 GB**\\n\\n| Item | Typical per‑instance usage | Number of instances | Rough total |\\n|------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|\\n| Goroutine stack (initial 8 k, grows with I/O) | ~8 k – 16 k | 15 432 leaked goroutines | 120–250 MiB |\\n| `net.Conn` object + read buffer (4 k or more) | ~4 k – 32 k | 15 432 | 60–500 MiB |\\n| Any application data kept alive by the leaked goroutine | variable | 15 432 | 1 GB+ (depends on the protocol payload) |\\n| Go runtime overhead (heap, GC, etc.) | 1 GB+ | – | 1–2 GB |\\n\\nAdding those together easily exceeds 2.5–3 GB, which triggered the runtime’s “out of memory” fatal error.\\n\\n**In short**\\n\\n* A routine that never exits (`func1`) keeps the I/O connection alive.  \\n* Each such routine holds a stack, a reference to the `net.Conn`, and its I/O buffers.  \\n* 15 432 of them → >2.8 GB of live memory → OOM crash.\",\n    \"log\": \"Identified goroutine leak as root cause leading to out‑of‑memory crash.\"\n}\n```\n", "final_results": {"output": "**Root cause**\n\nThe leak originates in **`myservice/stream.Handler.StartStream`**.  \nEvery call to `StartStream` spawns a new goroutine (`func1` in the log) that blocks on\n\n```go\nnet.(*conn).Read(...)\n```\n\nWhen the stream finishes the code never closes the connection or signals the goroutine to exit.  \nBecause the goroutine keeps a reference to the `net.Conn` (and the underlying read buffer), the Go runtime cannot reclaim those objects – the goroutine’s stack and the connection’s buffers stay resident in memory forever.\n\n**Why the memory ballooned to ~2.8 GB**\n\n| Item | Typical per‑instance usage | Number of instances | Rough total |\n|------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Goroutine stack (initial 8 k, grows with I/O) | ~8 k – 16 k | 15 432 leaked goroutines | 120–250 MiB |\n| `net.Conn` object + read buffer (4 k or more) | ~4 k – 32 k | 15 432 | 60–500 MiB |\n| Any application data kept alive by the leaked goroutine | variable | 15 432 | 1 GB+ (depends on the protocol payload) |\n| Go runtime overhead (heap, GC, etc.) | 1 GB+ | – | 1–2 GB |\n\nAdding those together easily exceeds 2.5–3 GB, which triggered the runtime’s “out of memory” fatal error.\n\n**In short**\n\n* A routine that never exits (`func1`) keeps the I/O connection alive.  \n* Each such routine holds a stack, a reference to the `net.Conn`, and its I/O buffers.  \n* 15 432 of them → >2.8 GB of live memory → OOM crash.", "log": "Identified goroutine leak as root cause leading to out‑of‑memory crash."}}}]}, "eval": {"pred": "**Root cause**\n\nThe leak originates in **`myservice/stream.Handler.StartStream`**.  \nEvery call to `StartStream` spawns a new goroutine (`func1` in the log) that blocks on\n\n```go\nnet.(*conn).Read(...)\n```\n\nWhen the stream finishes the code never closes the connection or signals the goroutine to exit.  \nBecause the goroutine keeps a reference to the `net.Conn` (and the underlying read buffer), the Go runtime cannot reclaim those objects – the goroutine’s stack and the connection’s buffers stay resident in memory forever.\n\n**Why the memory ballooned to ~2.8 GB**\n\n| Item | Typical per‑instance usage | Number of instances | Rough total |\n|------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Goroutine stack (initial 8 k, grows with I/O) | ~8 k – 16 k | 15 432 leaked goroutines | 120–250 MiB |\n| `net.Conn` object + read buffer (4 k or more) | ~4 k – 32 k | 15 432 | 60–500 MiB |\n| Any application data kept alive by the leaked goroutine | variable | 15 432 | 1 GB+ (depends on the protocol payload) |\n| Go runtime overhead (heap, GC, etc.) | 1 GB+ | – | 1–2 GB |\n\nAdding those together easily exceeds 2.5–3 GB, which triggered the runtime’s “out of memory” fatal error.\n\n**In short**\n\n* A routine that never exits (`func1`) keeps the I/O connection alive.  \n* Each such routine holds a stack, a reference to the `net.Conn`, and its I/O buffers.  \n* 15 432 of them → >2.8 GB of live memory → OOM crash.", "gold": "None", "corr": 0}}
